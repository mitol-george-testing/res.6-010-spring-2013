**Description:** This lecture covers attenuation of noise applied following amplification, moderation of nonlinearities located in the forward path, intentional inclusion of a nonlinearity in the feedback path, and demonstation of a nonlinear audio amplifier with added noise.

**Instructor:** James K. Roberge
